# The Ideas Man

## Name
I always thought the idea of much derided "Ideas Man" role in a company was quite funny. I read about these people on Reddit, HackerNews etc, but never came across someone who had this job. 

It became kind of mythical, imagine, being paid to sit in a room all day and think of ideas. 

## Reason 
Everyday so many different thoughts come into my head and I play around with them for a while in my brain, but then eventually I forget them. 

Some are pratical (which I have little interest in developing), some are dreadful and some are just bizarre. The bizarre ones maybe I would like to work on. 

So for posterity's sake I'm going to try to note some of them down.
