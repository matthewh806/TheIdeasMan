# The Ideas Man

## Name
I always thought the idea of the much derided "Ideas Man" role in a company was quite funny. I read about these people on Reddit, HackerNews etc, but never came across someone who had this job. 

It became kind of mythical, imagine, being paid to sit in a room all day and think of ideas. 

## Reason 
Everyday so many different thoughts come into my head and I play around with them for a while in my brain, but then eventually I forget them. 

Some are pratical (which I have little interest in developing), some are dreadful and some are just bizarre. The bizarre ones maybe I would like to work on. 

So for posterity's sake I'm going to try to note some of them down.

## Ideas
So, for the ideas themselves...

### Practical
#### Command line sample transfer for Volca Sample
I'm sat here watching a sync operation of about 30 samples I selected to load into my Sample using third party software.
This was a painstacking process of having to select the samples and put them onto a track on an individual basis. 

Korg have released an SDK called [syro](https://github.com/korginc/volcasample) (is that an Aphex Twin reference? I don't know) written in C allowing one to write their own tools for the job.

I would implement all of the basic operations and allow entire directories to be loaded at once. This is the major drawback of the software I'm currently using. There might be other software out which already satisfy my desires, but I'm  trying to learn a bit of C++, so some C can't harm :D.

The idea just popped to my head while speaking to a friend. This is one I am interested in doing for myself!

### Game
#### Landslide
A pixel art game based on a recent (and at this moment ongoing) relationship. We met in the workplace in Amsterdam and fell very passionately in love, we got to know eachother over the company Slack and before she left we exported the conversation to keep the memory. 

A game in which the player clicks through a series of chronological snippets of conversation and gradually the two characters come together on the screen with each passing day. After a time spent together they slowly start to drift apart until finally they are off the screen and a few final bubbles of text appear.

I would love for the dialogues to be from the genuine conversations, but I would only do so with the blessing of the girl this idea is inspired by and ultimately for. And fragmentary, yet somehow profound. Is that possible? 

The conversations are timestamped, so I would love the surroundings the characters are in to gradually change with the time and seasons. 

I love you.

### Humour
### People who don't need to exist any more
A webzine (+ maybe printed) about celebrities who have commented themselves into irrelevance. Like John Cleese [saying](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/31/bbc-dont-televise-monty-python-today-shows-bad-modern-comedy/) the politically correct BBC has banned laughter. Accompanied by crude drawings of said celebrities. It's like a morally smug version of [Doug Stanhopes Death Pool](https://www.dougstanhopescelebritydeathpool.com/).
